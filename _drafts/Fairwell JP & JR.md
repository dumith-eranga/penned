Dearest Juliens - Poublon & Renard - words fall short to express our regard
Guiding lights, steadfast and dear - you stood by us every passing year
Coaching, nudging, lending a hand - when we encountered trials unplanned
Times of sweat, joy and tears - now treasured memories from yesteryears
As you chart new paths on this day - we'll miss you dearly, and for you we'll pray
May your path be bright, your spirit stay true - all the best for what lies ahead of you
